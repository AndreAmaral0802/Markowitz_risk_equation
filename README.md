Markowitz Risk Equation for portfolio volatility 

The Markowitz Risk Equation, also known as the portfolio variance equation, is a fundamental concept in modern portfolio theory developed by Harry Markowitz. It provides a quantitative measure of the risk associated with a portfolio of assets.

At its core, the Markowitz Risk Equation considers the risk and return characteristics of individual assets within a portfolio, as well as the correlations between them. The equation takes into account the weights assigned to each asset in the portfolio and calculates the portfolio's overall risk, typically represented by the portfolio's variance or standard deviation.

Let's break down the equation step by step:

Asset Weights:
The Markowitz Risk Equation begins with determining the weights assigned to each asset in the portfolio. The weight represents the proportion of the portfolio's total value invested in a particular asset. These weights sum up to 1, indicating that the portfolio is fully invested.

Asset Standard Deviations:
Next, the equation considers the standard deviation of each asset. The standard deviation measures the historical volatility or risk associated with an asset's returns. It quantifies how much the asset's returns deviate from its average return. A higher standard deviation implies greater price fluctuations and hence higher risk.

Correlation Matrix:
The Markowitz Risk Equation incorporates the correlations between asset returns. The correlation matrix captures the relationships between each pair of assets in the portfolio. Correlation ranges between -1 and +1, with negative values indicating inverse relationships and positive values representing positive relationships. A correlation of +1 indicates perfect positive correlation, while -1 implies perfect negative correlation.

Covariance Matrix:
Using the correlation matrix, the equation derives the covariance matrix. Covariance measures how two assets move together in relation to their respective means. It takes into account both the standard deviations and the correlations. The covariance between two assets reflects their joint variability, indicating how they tend to behave in relation to each other.

Portfolio Variance or Standard Deviation:
Finally, the Markowitz Risk Equation combines the asset weights, standard deviations, and covariance matrix to calculate the portfolio's overall risk. The portfolio variance is obtained by multiplying the transpose of the weight vector with the covariance matrix and then multiplying the result by the weight vector itself. The square root of the portfolio variance gives the portfolio's standard deviation, which is a commonly used measure of risk.

By optimizing the asset weights in the portfolio, investors can aim to minimize the risk (portfolio variance) while maximizing returns. This optimization process is known as the mean-variance optimization and forms the basis for constructing efficient portfolios that offer the best risk-return tradeoff.

In summary, the Markowitz Risk Equation is a mathematical formula that considers the weights, standard deviations, and correlations of assets in a portfolio to quantify the portfolio's risk. It helps investors assess the potential volatility and uncertainty associated with their investment choices and enables them to make informed decisions to achieve their desired risk-return objectives.
